- 👋 Hi, I’m @meagancoleman
- 👀 I’m interested in the culinary realm, what's in the hidden corners of the world, all the varying narrations of life, psychoanalysis, and contributing to the world I want to live in through the projects I work on. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning game theory, advanced French & Spanish, cooking with microbes, private culinary projects with clients, online cooking classes 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that captures my attention and contributes to what I care about in the world.
